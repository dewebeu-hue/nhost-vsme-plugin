# Production Troubleshooting

Use this guide when the Vercel deployment loads but auth, real data, or share flows do not behave as expected.

## Diagnostics Endpoint Returns 404

Likely causes:

- Code was not pushed to GitHub.
- Vercel deployed an old commit.
- Route file is missing from `app/api/diagnostics/env/route.ts`.

Fix:

- Commit and push the latest code.
- Confirm the Vercel deployment commit matches the expected GitHub commit.
- Redeploy the latest commit.
- Confirm `/api/diagnostics/env` exists in the Vercel route list/build output.

## Diagnostics Env Value Is False

Likely causes:

- Environment variable is missing in Vercel Project Settings.
- Variable was added to Preview but not Production, or the reverse.
- Deployment was not redeployed after env changes.

Fix:

- Add the missing env variable in Vercel Project Settings.
- Confirm variables are configured for the correct environment.
- Redeploy after adding or changing env vars.

Required public variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_NHOST_SUBDOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_NHOST_REGION
NEXT_PUBLIC_NHOST_GRAPHQL_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_NHOST_AUTH_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_NHOST_STORAGE_URL
```

Required server-only variables:

```bash
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET
NHOST_ADMIN_SECRET
SHARE_LINK_COOKIE_SECRET
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_` is correct only for public Nhost URLs/config. Admin secrets and cookie secrets must never use `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

## Login Fails

Likely causes:

- Nhost allowed origins do not include the Vercel domain.
- Nhost auth redirect URLs are missing.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NHOST_AUTH_URL` is wrong.
- Env vars were added only to the wrong Vercel environment.
- Nhost email/password auth is disabled.

Fix:

- Add the Vercel domain to Nhost allowed origins.
- Add redirect URLs for locale/auth/dashboard routes and `/auth/callback`.
- Confirm the Auth URL matches the Nhost dashboard.
- Confirm env vars exist in the active Vercel environment.
- Redeploy after env changes.

## Login Works But Dashboard Has No Organization

Likely causes:

- `organization_members` row is missing.
- Onboarding failed.
- `organization_members.user_id` does not match the Nhost Auth user UUID.
- Hasura `organizations` or `organization_members` select permissions are missing.

Fix:

- Check the Nhost Auth user UUID.
- Check `organization_members.user_id`.
- Complete onboarding again if no workspace exists.
- Confirm Hasura permissions allow selecting organizations through membership.
- Check `/api/organizations/current` response category:
  - `no_organization`
  - `unauthenticated`
  - `permission_denied`
  - `env_missing`
  - `graphql_error`

## GraphQL Permission Denied

Likely causes:

- Hasura `user` role permissions are missing.
- Required relationships are not tracked.
- `X-Hasura-User-Id` condition is wrong.
- JWT/session variables are not reaching Hasura.

Fix:

- Confirm Hasura `user` role exists.
- Confirm Nhost JWT includes `X-Hasura-User-Id`.
- Track relationships listed in `docs/hasura-permissions.md`.
- Test with Hasura GraphiQL using the user's JWT/session headers.
- Confirm User A cannot see User B organization before pilot use.

## Questionnaire Does Not Save

Likely causes:

- `question_answers` insert/update permissions are missing.
- `organization_members.role` is `viewer`.
- User has no organization membership.
- Allowed columns do not include `organization_id`, `question_item_id`, `value`, `status`, or `internal_note`.

Fix:

- Confirm the user role is `owner`, `editor`, or `admin`.
- Confirm the user has an organization membership.
- Confirm `question_answers` insert/update permissions.
- Confirm `question_sections` and `question_items` select permissions.

## Documents Upload Fails

Likely causes:

- Nhost Storage is not enabled.
- Storage permissions are missing.
- `documents` insert permission is missing.
- Metadata insert fails after file upload.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NHOST_STORAGE_URL` is wrong.

Fix:

- Confirm Nhost Storage is enabled.
- Confirm Storage URL matches the Nhost dashboard.
- Confirm `documents` insert permission for owner/editor/admin.
- Confirm allowed insert columns include `file_id`, `file_name`, `file_size_bytes`, `mime_type`, `document_type`, `status`, and `expires_at`.

## Passport Page Says Generate Passport First

Likely causes:

- Passport has not been generated yet.
- Answers are not completed or reviewed.
- `supplier_passports` query permission is missing.
- Wrong organization context is loaded.

Fix:

- Click Generate Passport.
- Confirm a `supplier_passports` row exists.
- Confirm `readiness_score` and `generated_at` are set.
- Confirm the row belongs to the current organization.
- Confirm Hasura permissions for `supplier_passports`.

## Public Share Link Empty Or Blocked

Likely causes:

- Share link is expired or inactive.
- Password protection has not been verified.
- `share_links` server lookup failed.
- Passport row is missing.
- Share token is wrong.

Fix:

- Check the `share_links` row.
- Confirm `token`, `is_active`, and `expires_at`.
- Confirm the related `supplier_passports` row exists.
- For protected links, verify the password flow and confirm `SHARE_LINK_COOKIE_SECRET` is configured.
- Confirm public share routes do not expose internal fields.

## Public File Access Blocked

Likely causes:

- Document is not `reviewed` for `approved_only` links.
- Document is not linked for `all_linked_documents`.
- Document belongs to another organization.
- Nhost Storage does not allow the controlled server-side file read.

Fix:

- Confirm document status.
- Confirm `document_links` row exists when using all-linked visibility.
- Confirm document organization matches share link organization.
- Confirm Nhost Storage access strategy from `docs/nhost-storage.md`.

## Safe Logging Rules

Allowed categories:

- `env_missing`
- `unauthenticated`
- `no_organization`
- `permission_denied`
- `graphql_error`
- `storage_error`
- `share_link_expired`
- `share_link_inactive`
- `password_required`
- `password_invalid`

Never log:

- secrets
- passwords
- password hashes
- raw tokens
- full JWTs
- raw file ids
- storage paths
- admin secrets
